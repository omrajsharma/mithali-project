            "“We have to stop the devastating loss of our forests,” said U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, as reported by the BBC. He called on fellow leaders to “end humanity’s long history as nature’s conqueror, and instead become its custodian.”",
            "A total of 110 leaders signed the deforestation pledge at the two-week climate change summit in Glasgow. Signatories include heavily forested nations, such as Brazil, Canada, Russia, the U.S., the U.K., Indonesia, China and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
            "Businesses are hopping on the deforestation wagon. Some of the world’s biggest financial companies promised to stop investing in activities contributing to deforestation. Twenty-eight countries pledged to stop industries from chopping down trees to let animals graze or grow crops such as soy, cocoa and palm oil.",
            "Of course, activists quickly pointed out that climate change promises have been continuously broken. Notably, a similar pledge in 2014 barely saved a twig. Climate activist Greta Thunberg, speaking outside the CO26 venue, said a lot of “blah blah blah” was going on inside.",
            "Matt McGrath, the BBC’s environmental correspondent, raised some interesting points in his analysis. For example, how will countries be policed and held accountable for their promises? Are sovereign countries going to suddenly allow satellites to spy on their forests? How will we break the link between consumer good production and deforestation? And are governments going to actively push people to reduce their meat consumption, so as not to need all that soy feed and grazing land?",
            "Despite legitimate doubts, the deforestation pledge is a positive step. After all, not trying and doing nothing hasn’t worked too well."

            "The plan of action presented in Berlin pertains to both Germany's countryside and its cities. Lemke outlined five areas of activity, adding that concrete measures would be unveiled throughout the year."

            "Now fast forward a few years: the plastic’s still there – some of it, anyway – but now you happily chuck it in the compost bin, safe in the knowledge that in a few weeks it’ll be on your vegetable patch, or the council’s parks, doing nothing but good. Hell, you can even eat it too, if you have a mind to.",
            "Sounds like a pipe dream? Not a bit of it. Thanks to the innovative brilliance of one young German woman, that’s a more than plausible vision of the future. Dr Anne Lamp (pictured below) has designed a system to transform agricultural residues into a range of plastics, which in turn can be safely reintegrated into the food supply chain. ",
            "The process can cut carbon emissions by 87 per cent compared to conventional plastics production – and it promises to compete on price, too. Combining her engineering background with her passion for a ‘cradle to cradle’ lifecycle, Lamp has launched a new company, Traceless, to commercialise the idea. ",
            "It’s already attracting a lot of interest from potential customers, keen to respond to the growing demand to cut plastic waste – as well as meeting the EU’s ban on some single-use plastics, which comes into force this year.",
            "It’s an achievement that has won Traceless this year’s Green Alley Award. It recognises and celebrates startups that are successfully demonstrating the potential of the circular economy. The awards were founded in 2014 by Jan Patrick Schulz, CEO of the Landbell Group, a global provider of environmental and chemical compliance solutions.",
            "As Schulz puts it: “We want to foster business models that combine resource conservation with economic success [in a] holistic, bio-circular approach.” Traceless epitomized that aim, he added."
