And that’s in only the west of Virginia. Many locations in the state of Nevada are also prime candidates for future solar expansion, with over a million acres of minefields and brownfield sites ripe for the picking.",

            "Well believe it or not, an Australian start-up is doing exactly that.

            "Lemke said the plan was aimed at strengthening Germany's existing biodiversity and helping dampen the effects of climate change.",
            "\"Only by acting in this way do we have a chance at achieving our climate targets, becoming climate-neutral by 2045 and protecting the natural foundations of life for our children and grandchildren,\" Lemke said. \"It's high time we stopped working against nature and instead harness the existing synergies of nature and climate protection.\"",
            "The plan of action presented in Berlin pertains to both Germany's countryside and its cities. Lemke outlined five areas of activity, adding that concrete measures would be unveiled throughout the year."

            "Now fast forward a few years: the plastic’s still there – some of it, anyway – but now you happily chuck it in the compost bin, safe in the knowledge that in a few weeks it’ll be on your vegetable patch, or the council’s parks, doing nothing but good. Hell, you can even eat it too, if you have a mind to.",
            "Sounds like a pipe dream? Not a bit of it. Thanks to the innovative brilliance of one young German woman, that’s a more than plausible vision of the future. Dr Anne Lamp (pictured below) has designed a system to transform agricultural residues into a range of plastics, which in turn can be safely reintegrated into the food supply chain. ",
            "The process can cut carbon emissions by 87 per cent compared to conventional plastics production – and it promises to compete on price, too. Combining her engineering background with her passion for a ‘cradle to cradle’ lifecycle, Lamp has launched a new company, Traceless, to commercialise the idea. ",
            "It’s already attracting a lot of interest from potential customers, keen to respond to the growing demand to cut plastic waste – as well as meeting the EU’s ban on some single-use plastics, which comes into force this year.",
            "It’s an achievement that has won Traceless this year’s Green Alley Award. It recognises and celebrates startups that are successfully demonstrating the potential of the circular economy. The awards were founded in 2014 by Jan Patrick Schulz, CEO of the Landbell Group, a global provider of environmental and chemical compliance solutions.",
            "As Schulz puts it: “We want to foster business models that combine resource conservation with economic success [in a] holistic, bio-circular approach.” Traceless epitomized that aim, he added."
