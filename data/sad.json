      "JAKARTA - The world's COVID-19 deaths surpassed the five million mark on Friday, according to Reuters data. It took the world more than a year to reach the first 2.5 million COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic, but the second 2.5 million was achieved in just under eight months. An average of 8,000 deaths were reported daily worldwide in the past week, or about five deaths per minute. More than half of the global death toll in that week's average came from the United States, Russia, Brazil, Mexico and India. The total death toll in the US on Friday crossed 700,000, the highest in the world.",
      "While COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in the US are trending down, the country's health authorities are bracing for a spike in winter when people are more active indoors. On the same day Russia reported 887 deaths, the country's highest daily figure for a year pandemic. South America is the region with the highest mortality rate in the world, accounting for 21 percent of all reported deaths. ",
      "The region is followed by North America and Eastern Europe, which each account for more than 14 percent of all deaths, according to a Reuters analysis. , the death toll in India -- one of the countries hardest hit by the Delta variant -- has dropped dramatically from an average of 4,000 per day to less than 300 when the vaccination program was launched. Delta is now the world's dominant variant of the coronavirus and has been found in 187 of the 194 member countries of the World Health Organization (WHO). ",
      "These variants have shown different vaccination rates high levels between rich and poor countries. World attention in recent days has focused on efforts to share vaccines with poor countries, where many people have not received the first dose. At the same time, people in wealthier countries are starting to be given booster doses. More than half of the world's population has not received a single dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to Our World in Data. ",
      "WHO said this week that for the first time the COVAX program will distribute doses only to countries with the lowest vaccination rates. The vaccine sharing program since January has allocated most of the vaccine doses to more than 140 recipient countries in proportion to the population. assistant Director-General of WHO, in a recording of last week's conference presentation uploaded to the WHO's official website."

      "COVID, death and mourning in Germany: 'No one should have to die alone' People have been dying lonely deaths in nursing homes and hospitals around Germany due to coronavirus pandemic and restrictions on close contact. It has been devastating for those they leave behind.",
      "\"We weren't allowed to ride in the ambulance with him or enter the hospital. We couldn't talk to his doctors. It was horrific,\" says Silke Kleibömer, recalling the day her father was rushed to the hospital — April 28, his birthday. He was \"terrified,\" says his daughter, \"he knew his life was coming to an end.\"",
      "Hans-Jürgen had a pulmonary disease and had been on oxygen for years. He was doing so poorly that the family called paramedics. He died in the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) just seven days later.",
      "During the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic hospitals and nursing homes imposed restrictions and bans on outside contact. After a loosening of rules over the summer, they are once again getting stricter as infection rates rise. State and federal governments say they are committed to protecting at-risk individuals in hospitals and nursing homes.",
      "Rapid testing is to be implemented to facilitate visiting regulations, as restrictions don't just affect COVID-19 patients. They also affect people like Silke Kleibömer's father Heinz-Jürgen.",
      "In the hospital, doctors found that he had pneumonia. Silke Kleibömer says it was impossible to talk with her father on the telephone. \"We called him every day, for about 10 or 20 seconds,\" she says — after that he was out of breath. \"Anyone who has ever suffered shortness of breath knows that it's deadly terrifying,\" she adds.",
      "'He didn't want to go' When Silke's mother called the hospital to find out what the family should expect, she was harangued by a doctor who yelled at her that they didn't have the time to talk with every relative who called. When the father was moved  into intensive care, no one bothered to inform the family. Silke Kleibömer, who runs an outpatient nursing service herself, says she can't understand such attitudes: \"Then you have to delegate. We're just talking about making time for a phone call here.\"",
      "Indignant, Kleibömer called and demanded to speak with the ICU's on-duty doctor and told him: \"We're coming right now.\" When they got there, she and her mother got to see her father \"It was hard to understand him but he had all his faculties …\" Silke Kleibömer stops and begins to cry. She excuses herself and says, \"He told us he loved us. He was so strong, he looked me straight in the eye and told me not to cry. My dad fought so hard. He didn't want to go.\"",
      "'Papa waited for us' Visits were possible in ICU but only for one person and only for a maximum of one hour each day. Still, the staff were accommodating.",
      "That was also the case on May 5, when alarms began ringing at her father's bed. The call came from the hospital, saying: \"You have to come now! Hurry!\" Silke Kleibömer picked up her mother and rushed to the hospital. They assembled there at his side, wife, daughter, and three grandchildren: \"Papa waited for us. We could all be with him. We are so grateful to the ICU staff. We weren't really supposed to be there.\"",
      "She says the doctor told her \"every colleague decides for themselves,\" adding that they may not have been so lucky on another day. She knows how fortunate she and her family were, saying: \"We got to hold his hand.\" Then her father quickly and peacefully passed away, \"You could see the relief on his face.\""

      "One terrible thing about COVID-19 is not just that people are dying of it, but the circumstances in which they die. A COVID-19 death often occurs in isolation, behind closed doors. How can we cope with this? Reporters Nicola Albrecht and Susann von Lojewski examine how COVID-19 has changed our experience of death. They speak to people who have lost loved ones, such as Manu, who lost his fiancée Brittanya to COVID-19 - she was just 29. Posting on Instagram from her sickbed, rapper Brittanya gave herself and her fans confidence to fight the battle against the virus. ",

Often, intensive care workers are the last people allowed to accompany patients who are sick and dying of COVID-19. And even if they are now used to it, COVID-19 is pushing them to the limit. ",
      "Nurse Celine Pinkau from Senftenberg describes the moment she had to put a patient she’d grown fond of into a clinically sealed body bag. \"I cried. I thought, ‘Where is the humanity in this? Where is the dignity?’\" Hospital chaplains like Stefan Pfeifer are not always able to comfort bereaved family members. ",

Together, the United States, the European Union, Britain and Brazil — all upper-middle- or high-income countries — account for one-eighth of the world’s population but nearly half of all reported deaths.",
      "The U.S. alone has recorded over 745,000 lives lost, more than any other nation. “This is a defining moment in our lifetime,” said Dr. Albert Ko, an infectious disease specialist at the Yale School of Public Health. “What do we have to do to protect ourselves so we don’t get to another 5 million?” ",
      "The death toll, as tallied by Johns Hopkins University, is about equal to the populations of Los Angeles and San Francisco combined. It rivals the number of people killed in battles among nations since 1950, according to estimates from the Peace Research Institute Oslo. Globally, COVID-19 is now the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and stroke.",
      "The staggering figure is almost certainly an undercount because of limited testing and people dying at home without medical attention, especially in poor parts of the world, such as India. Canadians should get COVID-19 vaccine boosters? NACI updates guidelines Oct 29, 2021",
      "Hot spots have shifted over the 22 months since the outbreak began, turning different places on the world map red. Now, the virus is pummeling Russia, Ukraine and other parts of Eastern Europe, especially where rumors, misinformation and distrust in government have hobbled vaccination efforts. In Ukraine, only 17% of the adult population is fully vaccinated; in Armenia, only 7%.",
      "“What’s uniquely different about this pandemic is it hit hardest the high-resource countries,” said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, director of ICAP, a global health center at Columbia University. “That’s the irony of COVID-19.”",
      "Wealthier nations with longer life expectancies have larger proportions of older people, cancer survivors and nursing home residents, all of whom are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, El-Sadr noted. Poorer countries tend to have larger shares of children, teens and young adults, who are less likely to fall seriously ill from the coronavirus.",
      "India, despite its terrifying delta surge that peaked in early May, now has a much lower reported daily death rate than wealthier Russia, the U.S. or Britain, though there is uncertainty around its figures. The seeming disconnect between wealth and health is a paradox that disease experts will be pondering for years.",
      "But the pattern that is seen on the grand scale, when nations are compared, is different when examined at closer range. Within each wealthy country, when deaths and infections are mapped, poorer neighborhoods are hit hardest. In the U.S., for example, COVID-19 has taken an outsize toll on Black and Hispanic people, who are more likely than white people to live in poverty and have less access to health care."

      "Nearly a quarter of those deaths — some 24,000 — occurred in the most recent wave of infection that began in October, a period in which vaccines have been widely available in the European Union nation of 38 million people.",
      "Health Minister Adam Niedzielski said Tuesday that 493 more people with COVID-19 had died, pushing the overall pandemic death toll to 100,254 in the central European nation.",
      "The bleak marker comes as daily new infections have fallen following a peak in what officials call the country's “fourth wave” of COVID-19 driven by the delta variant. But with the omicron variant spreading, another large infection wave is looming.",
      "The first two deaths from omicron were reported Monday, both in elderly and unvaccinated people. Niedzielski said over 18,000 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, making this “the most difficult situation compared to other waves.”", 
      "Poland has struggled through the pandemic with a health care sector strapped by limited funding and the emigration of many medical professionals to Western Europe in the past two decades.",
      "According to OECD statistics, Poland is the EU nation with the lowest number of working doctors in proportion to its population — just 2.4 to 1,000 inhabitants compared with 4.5 in Germany. Poland also has only 5 nurses to 1,000 inhabitants, below the EU average of 8 and far below richer countries like Germany, which has 14.",
      "The vast majority of COVID-19 deaths in the last wave — 83% — are of unvaccinated people. Among people under 44, more than 90% of those who died were not vaccinated. The vaccination rate in Poland is nearly 56% — much lower than countries in Western Europe but much higher than some other central European countries like Bulgaria and Romania",
      "Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki's government has sought to encourage vaccinations but is also up against fears and hesitancy among some in the population — and sometimes among the governing Law and Justice party's own supporters.",

She claimed that “the consequences of this experiment are not fully established.\"",

      "Myocarditis risk higher after Covid infection than Pfizer or Moderna vaccination, CDC finds. People infected with Covid-19 face a higher risk of myocarditis and other inflammatory heart conditions than those vaccinated against the disease, according a large study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday.",
      "The CDC found the risk of myocarditis, pericarditis and multisystem inflammatory syndrome was higher after Covid infection than after Pfizer or Moderna vaccination in males and females ages 5 and older. However, these cardiac conditions are rare after infection and vaccination alike, according to the CDC.",
      "Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis is an inflammation of the outer heart lining. Multisystem inflammatory is a condition associated with Covid infection that affects multiple organ systems.",
      "Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines have been associated with an elevated risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose, particularly among boys ages 12- to 17-years-old. However, even in this group the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis was higher after Covid infection than after vaccination, according to the CDC.",
      "Among teenage boys, the rate of myocarditis or pericarditis after infection was at least 50 cases per 100,000 people, compared to at least 22 cases per 100,000 after the second vaccine dose. The overall risk of heart conditions after Covid infection was up to 5.6 times higher compared to the second vaccine dose. The risk was up to 69 times higher after infection compared to the first shot.",
      "The CDC examined the electronic health records of more than 15 million people ages 5 and older across 40 health-care systems from Jan. 2021 through Jan. 2022. Scientists studied the risk of developing a cardiac condition after a Covid infection compared to the first and second doses of Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines. The study excluded booster doses from the comparison.",
      "Overall, the risk of a heart issue after Covid infection was anywhere from 2 to 115 times higher compared to vaccination depending on age, gender and the dose administered.",
      "In February, the CDC said males age 12- to 39-years-old should consider waiting eight weeks between the first and second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines to reduce the risk of myocarditis. Canadian public health authorities had found that the rate of myocarditis after Pfizer or Moderna vaccination was higher when the time between the first and second dose was fewer than 30 days.",
      "Moderna’s second dose appears associated with a higher risk of myocarditis than Pfizer’s, according to data presented to the CDC’s committee of vaccine experts in February. Public health authorities in Ontario, Canada have found that the rate of myocarditis was 5 times higher for males ages 18-24 following a second dose of Moderna compared to Pfizer.",
      "However, the overwhelming majority of people who developed myocarditis after vaccination recovered fully and most of them did not report any effect on their quality of life, according to a CDC survey of health-care providers presented at the February meeting."

      "Chris Cramer, Corporate Communications Senior Director at CVS told ABC News, \"Patient samples collected at our COVID-19 drive-thru testing sites are sent offsite to independent, third-party labs that are responsible for processing the results. While we cannot comment on the accuracy rate of a third party lab’s test results, PCR tests such as the ones used by the labs on the samples collected at our drive-thru testing sites are considered to be more accurate than any other type of diagnostic testing for COVID-19 that is currently available.\"",
